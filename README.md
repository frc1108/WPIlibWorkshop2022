# WPIlibWorkshop2022

This code orginated during our workshop at Ray-Pec (Fall 22) and updated SAM (2022 Robot)
to use newer WPIlib code implementation inclusing Trigger class for buttons, CommandXboxControllers, and 
command factories in subsystems.  These are the basis for 2023 code implementation.

The DriveSubsystem is for a tank-styled KoP chassis which is not compatible with the swerve drive.  But
this would be a good starting point for the above drive types.

For SAM 2023, this did not implement all the subsystems yet, so more work would need to be done to add those.
However, the robot has been partially decommissioned, with mainly the drive intact.
